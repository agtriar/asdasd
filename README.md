BIKE RENTAL   Each customer has a name, the number of members he arrived with, and the date time he rents a bike, from now on, the "Check-In".  The reason behind saving the Check-in is to be able to know the amount of time that the customer must.  The fees are:  Rental by hour: $5 per hour. Rental by day: $20 per day. Rental by week: $60 per week Family discount for parties of 3-5 members.  Once the costumer starts the check-out process, the solution computes the price according to the time spent. The solution will always benefit the client in certain situations. These situations are:  If the customer rents for more than 4 hours, it will automatically be assigned the daily fee. E.g.: 5 hours for $20 instead of $25 If the customer rents for more than 3 days, it will automatically be assigned the weekly fee. E.g.: 4 days for $60 instead of $80. Rentals for more than a week will be automatically be categorize as weekly time.
